Big Processes are a Big Topic in data analytics. This is particularly true in enterprises who are placing a heavy emphasis on operational efficiency and are looking to move towards a culture of continual improvement.

One of the ways businesses are tackling process analysis is via techniques like "process mining". 

Process mining is a a set of analytical techniques we can use to gain insights into the following types of questions:

- Process discovery - what is really happening, understand the current process, especially where no previous odel of a process may exist

- How often are activities performed ?
- Who are the fastest at performing certain tasks ?

- What is the "cycle" time ? What is the "waiting" time ?

- How often do "handoffs" occur ?

- ... and many other questions !

Tools like R provide an ideal platform for getting into a journey of process mining.

There is a brilliant R library centered on process mining from the people here:

  Gert Janssenswillen (2020). bupaR: Business Process Analysis in R. R package
  version 0.4.4. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bupaR

```{r do_initial, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bupaR)
```

I'm going to use bupaR and its suite of packages to explore a dataset of transactional event log type data to learn a bit about the processes associated this data. 

```{r get_the_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(bupaR)
library(readxl)
library(processanimateR)
eldata <- read_excel("G:/OneDrive/Documents/buparProject/datasfs/AuditExtract1.neutralise.xlsx")

wfted <- eldata

wftel <- wfted %>%
  mutate(status = "complete",
         activity_instance = 1:nrow(.)) %>%
  eventlog(
    case_id = "AuditDealID",
    activity_id = "StatusDescription",
    activity_instance_id = "rowid",
    lifecycle_id = "status",
    timestamp = "CreatedTimestamp",
    resource_id = "ResourceName2"
  )

process_map(wftel)

# animate_process(eldata)

# eldata
nrow(eldata)

```
