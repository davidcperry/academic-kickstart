Big Processes are a Big Topic in data analytics. This is particularly true in enterprises who are placing a heavy emphasis on operational efficiency and are looking to move towards a culture of continual improvement.

One of the ways businesses are tackling process analysis is via techniques like "process mining". 

Process mining is a a set of analytical techniques we can use to gain insights into the following types of questions:

- Process discovery - what is really happening, understand the current process, especially where no previous odel of a process may exist

- How often are activities performed ?

- Who are the fastest at performing certain tasks ?

- What is the "cycle" time ? What is the "waiting" time ?

- How often do "handoffs" occur ?

- ... and many other questions !

Tools like R provide an ideal platform for getting into a journey of process mining.

There is a brilliant R library centered on process mining from the people here:

```{r}
library(bupaR)
citation("bupaR")
```

I'm going to use buparR and its suite of packages to explore a dataset of transactional event log type data to learn a bit about the processes associated this data. 

```{r}

library(bupaR)
library(processanimateR)
eldata <- read_xes("G:/OneDrive/Documents/buparProject/data/GT_p1_t1.xes")
process_map(eldata)

animate_process(eldata)

# eldata
nrow(eldata)


```
